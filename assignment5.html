            <p>Munnar, nestled in the Western Ghats of Kerala, is a serene hill station known for its lush tea plantations, cool climate, and misty mountains. During my recent trip, I was enchanted by the endless green valleys and the calming rhythm of nature .I started my journey with a visit to the Tea Museum, followed by a drive through scenic winding roads. Echo Point, with its natural acoustics, and the Eravikulam National Park were some of the highlights of my trip</p>
